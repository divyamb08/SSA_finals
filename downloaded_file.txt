ASSIGNMENT 2: INTERACTIVE INFORMATION VISUALIZATION EDA  1. The dataset. I have chosen the US Interna0onal Air Traﬃc Data (1990 – 2020) The data comes from the U.S. Interna4onal Air Passenger and Freight Sta4s4cs Report. As part of the T-100 program, USDOT receives traﬃc reports of US and interna4onal airlines opera4ng to and from US airports. Data on all ﬂights between US gateways and non-US gateways, irrespec4ve of origin and des4na4on. Each observa4on provides informa4on on a speciﬁc airline for a pair of airports, one in the US and the other outside. Three main columns record the number of ﬂights: Scheduled, Charter, and Total. Link to the dataset - Dataset  2. Mo4va4on Behind Choosing the Dataset. The main mo4va4on for me to choose this dataset was to analyze the trends in the Aerospace department, especially the United States Airspace. The dataset has 16 columns and 366084 data entries which makes it ideal for the project. Because of the large number of rows, it is easier to analyze trends in the dataset and answer some of the underlying ques4ons.   3. The columns in the dataset.  Column Name Description Type data_dte Data Date Date & Time  Year Data Year Number  Month Data Month Number  usg_apt_id US Gateway Airport ID - assigned by US DOT to identify an airport Number  usg_apt US Gateway Airport Code - usually assigned by IATA, but in absence of IATA designation, may show FAA-assigned code Plain Text  usg_wac US Gateway World Area Code - assigned by US DOT to represent a geographic territory Number  Column Name Description Type fg_apt_id Foreign Gateway Airport ID - assigned by US DOT to identify an airport Number  fg_apt Foreign Gateway Airport Code - usually assigned by IATA, but in absense of IATA designation, may show FAA-assigned code Plain Text  fg_wac Foreign Gateway World Area Code - assigned by US DOT to represent a geographic territory Number  airlineid Airline ID - assigned by US DOT to identify an air carrier Number  carrier IATA-assigned air carrier code. If carrier has no IATA code, ICAO- or FAA-assigned code may be used Plain Text  carriergroup Carrier Group Code - 1 denotes US domestic air carriers, 0 denotes foreign air carriers Number  type Defines the type of the four metrics in this report Plain Text  Scheduled Metric flown by scheduled service operations Number  Charter Metric flown by charter operations Number  Total Total Metric flown by scheduled service and charter operations Number   4. Ques4on to be answered. What are the crucial elements inﬂuencing the opera4onal outcomes of airlines in a speciﬁc region, considering factors like airport traﬃc, seasonal varia4ons, and the popularity of routes? How do these elements interact to shape the overall dynamics of the airline industry in that region?  5. Data cleaning process: There are many rows with missing values in the dataset. It is very diﬃcult to impute the nominal values like fg_apt, usg_apt, and carrier. The count of such rows was less than 0.1 percent and instead of impu4ng, I removed those rows. The rest of the values were imputed using sklearn simple imputer. The strategy used is called the “most frequent” strategy.         The busiest airports in the country:  First, let’s start oﬀ the discussion by gecng a sense of how many total ﬂights are taken by passengers in a par4cular year.   
 Figure 1: Total number of Flights in a Year Here we can see that the total number of ﬂights in a par4cular year is increasing which is what is to be expected. As the popula4on and economy of a country increases, so does the need for commute. Here, the number of ﬂights in a year is encoded using length on a bar chart.         
   Next, I’d like to take the column name US gateway Airport (usg_apt) and map out the total number of ﬂights from that airport.  
 Figure 2: A map of the United States Domes=c Airports In this map, each red dot denotes an airport. The number of ﬂights taken from an airport is encoded using the size of the red dot. The bigger the size, the more the number of domes4c ﬂights scheduled from an airport. From this ﬁgure, we can say that the bigger a nearby city is, the more the number of domes4c ﬂights from the closest airport. This map shows all the domes4c airports in the United States, but because the number of ﬂights is denoted by the size of each dot, it is diﬃcult to es4mate which of the airports are the busiest. Thus, we need a more quan4ta4ve approach to this. 
 Figure 3: Total ﬂights from the Airports with the Highest Number of Domes=c Flights Figure 3 shows us the airports with the highest number of domes4c ﬂights.                     
Now let us do the same for interna4onal ﬂights.  
 Figure 4: A map of the United States showing Interna=onal Airports Similar to the domes4c plot, ﬁgure 4 shows us all the interna4onal airports in the United States of America. The airport is encoded with a dot/point and the number of ﬂights taking oﬀ from that airport is encoded with the size of the dot. Similarly, we plot a bar graph to quan4fy the total number of interna4onal ﬂights from United States. 
 Figure 5: Total ﬂights from the Airports with the Highest Number of Interna=onal Flights 
Figure 5 shows us the airports with the highest number of interna4onal ﬂights. We can see that JFK and LAX are the airports with the highest number of interna4onal ﬂights. Now, a natural ques4on is what the ra4o of domes4c ﬂights to interna4onal ﬂights every year is. 
 Figure 6: Ra=o of interna=onal to domes=c ﬂights every year                   
Which months of the year are the busiest? Concerned columns: Month, Total To see the trends in the years 2010 to 2020, we try to plot seasonal data. This is done by aggrega4ng the months to a par4cular season. Figure 7 shows which seasons are the busiest for airports. 
 Figure 7: Air traﬃc for every season From Figure 7 we can see the ﬂights taken for every season. I had always thought that the highest number of ﬂights per season would be by winter since it is the holiday season with the highest number of interna4onal ﬂights. But this is not the case. Summers are the highest followed by spring.           
A follow-up ques4on is how many of these ﬂights are scheduled and how many are chartered. For this, we look at the scheduled and charted columns. Figure 8 shows us how they stack up to each other. 
 Figure 8: Scheduled vs Chartered ﬂights                   
What were the top airlines in the United States with the highest number of ﬂights? Concerned columns: Carrier, Total Figure 9 shows us the airline carriers with the highest number of ﬂights. 
 Figure 9: Flight carriers with the highest number of ﬂights  Here, we can see that American Airlines is the highest with a total of 26,951 ﬂights.           
The busiest routes by ﬂights: Concerned columns: usg_apt, fg_apt, Total 
 Figure 10: Busiest ﬂight routes Here we can see that the busiest route is LGA to YYZ.  Let's try to ﬁnd out the most popular carriers and the trends for those carriers.  
 Figure 11: Carrier Trends in the past 20 years There are 2 things to note from Figure 11. Firstly, the total metric trends for every airline carrier have decreased over the past 20 years. Secondly, the top airline carriers are AC (foreign), DL, AA, and UA.     
As per Figure 9, our main concentra4on is to ﬁnd trends for the top airline carriers i.e., ‘AA’, ‘UA’, and ‘DL’.  I’d like to ﬁnd out if there is any rela4on between the ﬂights in a par4cular month and the total popularity of a par4cular airline. As per Figure 7, we can see that the highest number of ﬂights in a year take oﬀ during the summer season.   
 Figure 12: Top 3 carriers per Month (Total) As per Figure 12, we can see that the number of ﬂights by ‘AA’ is approximately double that of either ‘UA’ or ‘DL’. But this is the reference image for the data collected over 20 years. It is highly possible that this might not be the correct depic4on of the business being generated by these companies now. As we can infer from Figure 11, the total number of ﬂights for ‘AA’ has reduced signiﬁcantly over the past 20 years.  Let us try to analyze the case using a par4cular year, 2019.  
 Figure 13:Top airline carriers per Month in 2019 Here, we can see that the diﬀerence in business for the top 3 airline carriers is not a lot.  Also, we can see from the image that the highest number of ﬂights for every airline carrier is in months 6,7 and 8. This goes in conjunc4on with our analysis that the highest number of ﬂights taken per year are during the summer months.  Finally, I’d like to analyze the number of ﬂights and the trends on the busiest routes to judge if these top airlines have a considerable number of ﬂights on these busiest routes.  
 Figure 14: Top Airline Carriers on the busiest routes Figure 14 is made concerning Figure 10, showing us the busiest routes and the top airline carrier on these routes. As we can see, there are no instances of ‘UA’ and ‘DL’ on any of these routes. ‘AA’ is present on merely 2 of these routes, that too on the 8th and 10th busiest routes.  Now, let’s look at the top 3 airline carriers on the busiest routes.  
 Figure 15: Top 3 airline carriers on busiest routes 
Based on the data shown in Figure 15, it is evident that 'AA' and 'UA' have mul4ple instances on these routes while 'DL' has none. It can be concluded that 'DL' needs to increase its ﬂights on these routes in order to compete and become the top airline carrier.

Global epidemiologic al situation  
Since the last Weekly Epidemiological Update  issued on 5 October, over 2.2 million new cases and 39,000 
deaths of COVID -19 have been reported across  all six WHO regions. This is the highest number of reported 
cases so far in a single week.  
  
From 30 December through 11 October, over 37 million COVID -19 cases and 1 million deaths have been 
reported globally. Nearly half of these cases (48%) and deaths (5 5%) continue to be reported in the Region of 
the Americas with the United States of America, Brazil and Argentina accounting for the greatest numbers  of 
new cases and deaths in the region.

 By WHO region, the European Region reported the greatest increase (34%) in cases in the past week while the 
African Region reported a substantial rise in deaths, with a 27% increase compared to the previous week. 
Within the African Region, South Africa continues to register more than half  (56% , 690 896) of all reported 
confirmed cases.  
 
For the third week in a row, the South -East Asia Region reported a decline in new cases and deaths, 6% and 8% 
respectively, compared to the previous week. The decline is mainly due to decrease s in reported cases in India 
and Bangladesh.  
 
For the second week in a row, the Regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific reported 
increase s in cases and deaths.  
 
Overall, during the reporting period, all the Regions showed an increase in cases except the South -East Asia 
Region.

 Situation by WHO Region  
African Region  
Although the Region had seen a slow but continuous decline in newly - reported cases since mid -July, there 
were 11% more cases reported in the last 7 days  compared to  the prior week, reaching a total of over 1 200 
000 cases ( Figure 1, Figure 3). The current figures in the region represent 1% of confirmed COVID -19 cases 
and 3% of deaths reported worldwide in the past week.  The increase in the number of newly - confirmed 
cases is partially attributed to the higher number of countries reporting an increase in cases (21 countries), 
compared to the previous week (14 coun tries). Although there are a greater number of countries reporting 
increases, the pattern of increasing cases is driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, which continue to report the 
highest numbers of new cases in the last 7 days, followed by Kenya, Uganda, a nd Algeria. Continuing the 
trend from last week, the number of reported deaths  increased this week with South Africa accounting  for 
the majority of the new deaths in the Region (74%).  
 
The current transmission pattern in the majority  of the 47 Member States in the African Region is reported as 
community transmission (n=39, 83%), with five reporting clusters of cases, and only Seychelles, Mauritius 
and Eritrea currently reporting sporadic cases.  
 
South Sudan has reported a decrease in the number of newly -reported cases with an epidemiological link, 
with 29% in the past week, compared to 67% the week prior. This is attributed to a decrease in the 
proportion of cases that have been  detected at a border crossing, where a history of travel can inform an 
epidemiological link.  
 
This past  week, Mozambique registered 795 new cases (25 per million population ) bringing the total figure to 
almost 10  000 cases. Nevertheless, the country has registered a gradual decline over the last three wee ks 
including a 39 and 40% decrease  in new cases and deaths respectively in the past week , suggesting the 
epidemic may be slowing down in the country.  While the number of tests per 1000 inhabitants has remained 
quite stable at 0.3 over the last 10 weeks, t he test positivity rate has dropped this week to 9%. Schools have 
reopened with special measures to prevent further spread of the virus.

 Region of the Americas  
The Region of the Americas reported over 800 000 new cases in the last seven days, a 6% increase in the number 
of new cases in the past week which is a bigger increase than the increase reported in the previous week. greater 
change than the week prior. The Unit ed States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia registered the 
highest number of newly - reported cases .  
The Region  also continues to account for a majority of all deaths reported globally in the past week (n=20 500, 
52%). Mexico, the Unit ed States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia registered the highest number of new 
deaths.  
 
This past week, t he United States of America reported the largest increase in newly -reported cases since early 
August, with over 327 000 cases  reported. Ten of the 50 states reported the highest one -day increases in cases 
since their first reported case, including many in the Midwest and the Southwest, and three states reported their 
largest- ever one -day increase in new deaths.  
  
The number of newly - reported cases has been increasing in Canada since mid -September, with an increase of 
26.7% cases and 14.3% deaths in the past week. Most of the cases and deaths were reported in Québec and 
Ontario. Outbreaks in long -term care and retirement residences continue to account for most outbreaks in 
Canada to date. Since mid -July, incidence rates in those 20 to 39 years of age have remained consistently higher 
than all other age groups. Since mid -September, an increasing trend in the daily number of cases 20 to 39 years of 
age hospitalized has been observed.  
  
Costa Rica, with the second -highest incidence of cases per million population in the Region , has now reached over 
86 000 cases and over  1 000 deaths. During the last 5 weeks, the country had reached a plateau with comparable 
figures of reported cases and deaths. The country has reported over 107 COVID -19 hospitalizations per million 
inhabitants of which over a third of them are in intensi ve care units.

 Eastern Mediterranean Region  
In the Eastern Mediterranean region the weekly number of new cases and deaths have increased by 10% and 
13% respectively in comparison to the previous week. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the worst affected  
country in the regi on, accounting for 20% of all new cases reported this week.  
 
The number of new cases in Oman has more than doubled in the last week (from approximately 2 600 to 
over 5 500)  amounting to an increase of more than 60% . This past week a 100 bed field hospital for COVID -19 
patients along with an isolation center in the city of Sohar , the capital and largest city of the Al Batinah North 
Governorate  and another isolation ward in Su r Hospita l in the South Sharqiya region were opened to help 
mitigate the rising number of COVID -19 cases in the country.   
In Tunisia, there have been peak new cases (over 2 500) and deaths (over 40) also reported this week and the 
country plans to impose increased public health and safety measures including bans on gatherings, cutting 
public sector work hours  and imposing cur fews  in an effort to interrupt  transmission.

European Region  
The Region registered the highest weekly incidence of COVID -19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic 
with almost 700 000 new cases reported. The weekly incidence in cases a nd deaths increased by 34% and 
16% respectively in comparison to the previous week ( Figure 6). The Region is the second most active, 
contributing almost a third (n=694 275, 31%) of new weekly cases reported globally. The United Kingdom, 
France, the Russian  Federation and Spain account for over half of all new cases reported in the region (n= 
355 455, 51%).  
 
Latvia, Faroe Islands and Iceland have reported the greatest percentage increase in new cases in the past 
week while a marked decrease was reported in Isle of Man, Malta and Spain. The majority of the countries in 
the region self -characteri ze their current  transmission pattern as community transmission (n=30, 56%) or 
clusters of cases (n=20, 37%) with only Liechtenstein, Monaco and the Holy See reporting sporadic 
transmission.  
  
Spain, with over 50 000 cases reported in the past week, is showing a noticeab le decline in the weekly 
incidence of cases and deaths of 24% and 19% respectively. In the past week, over 740 000 polymerase chain 
reaction ( PCR) diagnostic  tests were carried out (16 tests per 1000 inhabitants per week). As of 08 of 
October, the bed occ upancy in intensive care unit s ranged between 7% and 39% across all regions.   
The incidence of cases and deaths in Poland increased this week by 93% and 104% respectively compared to 
the previous week, with almost 23 500 new cases and 370 deaths reported. Poland is tightening public health 
and social  measures in response to these ma rked increases in an effort to avoid another lockdown. A 
coordination hospital will be created in each provide to manage the surge in COVID -19 patients.

 South -East Asia Region  
The gradual decline in incidence of cases and deaths in the South East Asia Region continued during the past 
week. The Region, nevertheless, remains among the most active, accounting for 25% of cases and 20% of 
deaths newly reported globally in the past seven days ( Figure 7).   
 
The countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the South -East Asia Region continue to be India, 
Indonesia and Nepal, while Sri Lanka and Bhutan are showing the highest increase in the proportion of new 
cases in the past week compared to the previous week. Across the ten countries in the region, only Myanmar 
and Nepal  reported  an increase in the number of new deaths  in the past week compared to the previous 
week.  The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths per million population are India and 
Myanmar, with 5 and 4 new deaths per million population respectively. In contrast to the other regions with 
currently high case incidence, most of the 10 Member States in the South -East Asian Region self -report their 
current transmission pattern as either clusters of cases (n=6) or sporadic cases (n=2), with only Bangladesh 
and Indonesia currently reporting community transmission.  
 
Sri Lanka reported over 1200 new confirmed cases in the past epidemiological week, a substantial increase 
compared to the 46 cases confirmed the previous reporting week.  In a recent development, a large cluster 
of cases (831 cases as on 7 October 2020) wa s reported in an apparel manufacturing factory in Gamphana 
district about 50 km from Colombo. The exact epidemiological link is currently under investigation  
 
The reported number of cases increased rapidly in Nepal in the past week, with over 21 000 new ca ses and 
86 new deaths reported. Although the test positivity rate has raised from 5 to 15% in just 8 weeks, there has 
also been an expansion in testing activity, which is currently around 3 samples tested / 1000 persons per 
week.

Western Pacific Region  
The Western Pacific region accounts for the least number of reported cases globally this week, however , the 
region has experienced an increase of 6% in new ly- reported cases and a 26% increase in reported deaths in 
the past seven days.  
 
New cases in the Philippines have stabilized over the past 3 weeks with around 18 000 cases reported 
weekly, lower than the peak of around 30 000 weekly new cases in early to mid - August however it does 
continue to  account for the greatest number of new cases in the region. Reports suggest  clustering of cases 
has occurred in several workplaces in Davao Region following the easing of lockdown restrictions under the 
modified general community quarantine and reopening of the econom ic measures, with most of the clusters 
reported in 12 establishments.  As of October 12, the total number of cases in Davao Region is 3,743 with 686 
cases reported in the past two weeks and Davao City (the capital) contributing 65% of the total cases in the 
region. There are also reports of near capacity utilization of ICU and Ward beds, in the ma jor hospital in the 
region last week.   
 
In French Polynesia, there  were peak new cases this week , a 62% increase from last week, with reports 
suggesting  most cases were detected from the main island of Tahiti, with cases spreading to adjacent islands 
of M oorea and even reaching several outer islands, including Raivavae, Arutua, and Nuku Hiva.  Deaths in 
French Polynesia remain low and have not increased in the past week. The positivity rate of COVID -19 tests is 
currently high, at 26.3%, how ever only symptom atic persons are being tested.

 Surveillance update of the impact of COVID -19 on health workers  
Delivering the diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine interventions for COVID -19, while maintaining essential 
health services, requires a healthy, trained, competent, equipped, protected, well -managed, and 
appropriately staffed multi -disciplinary healthcare workforce. Health and social  care workers both salaried 
and volunteer, face multiple challenges due to COVID -19, leading to either an increased workload o r 
absences from work. Challenges include  pre-existing workforce shortages; repurposing of staff to the 
COVID -19 response;  infections and deaths; quarantine and self -isolation requirements; stress and burn -
out; shortages of critical equipment and supplies,  such as personal protective equipment (PPE); 
inadequate training; labo r disputes; and having to care for infected friends and family. A comprehensive 
assessment of the impact of COVID -19 on health and socia l care workers should utilize standardized 
measu rements and reporting to adequately qualify the impact. Internationally agreed indicators exist, and 
they form part of WHO’s ongoing surveillance and communications activities. Health  and social workers, 
in contact with COVID -19 patients and/or who care fo r COVID -19 patients,  are at a higher risk of infection 
than the general population. Mitigating and reducing this risk, and following WHO guidance (see below), 
is essential.  
WHO collects case -based surveillance data from Member States using Case Report Forms (CRFs)  via the 
WHO global surveillance for COVID -19. As of 14 September 2020, the CRF database contained 8 233 444 
forms, representing 28.4% of the cases recorded globally by that date. The CRFs facilitate a descriptive 
analysis of infections, hospitalizations, c linical outcomes, and sub -population analysis (such as occupation 
notified as health worker).  
An analysis o f health worker (HW) information was conducted on 281 083 HWs from amongst 1 932 941 
CRFs that indicated HW1 status (23.5% of all CRFs) from 83 coun tries. These data, covering primarily 
European and American countries, estimate that around 14% of COVID -19 cases reported to WHO are 
identified as occurring in health workers. There are wide differences in the reported proportion of HW 
affected between co untries. The overall mean estimate of infections amongst HWs illustrates a clear over 
representation of cases, given that they represent less than 3% of the population, globally, and less than 
8% on average in high -income countries.   
Encouragingly, t he data indicate that there has been a substantial decline in HW infection since the 
beginning of the epidemic, independent of the overall change in incidence of cases. In many countries, 
this is likely due to the increased availability of PPE and better a dherence to infection prevention and 
control (IPC) guidance. Figure 9 shows monthly trends in HW infection, using data from selected European 
countries2. The trends show that in the last 3 months prior to the analysis the proportion of cases amongst 
HWs wa s closer to their share of the general population.  
 
 
 
 
1 For the purposes of the case -based surveillance, ‘health workers’ were defined as those working “any job in a health care setting”.  
2 Data covering only countries  reporting at least 70% of cases in CRF, with at least 70% of CRFs hav ing a known HW status, with at least 
500 HW infections reported.   
   
 Figure 9. Share of health workers amongst total reported infections in selected countries, by month of 
reporting, March -August 2020  
 
The mean age of COVID -19 cases of HWs was 40 years  (IQR 31 -49), lower than the mean age of non -HWs, 
46 years (IQR 31 -60). The dis tribution of HW infections in women (67%) and men (29%) (4% unknown sex) 
is proportionate to the global share of women and men in the health workforce. This is notably different 
from the ratio of infections in females versus males for the general populatio n, where males account for 
53% of cases.  
WHO compared the proportions of COVID -19 case -patients with comorbidities, hospitalization and death 
as an outcome by age categories and sex in HWs and non -HWs, using information from five countries in 
the Americas and Europe with complete data. A total of 13% (n = 37 446) of HW case -patients reported 
underlying comorbidities (Figure 10), including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, such as 
hypertension. Of HW case -patients, 5% (n = 15 141) required hospitalizatio n (Figure 11), and of these, 
5.3% (n = 799) required oxygen therapy. Overall, 0.5% (n = 1417) of the HW cases were fatal (Figure 12). 
As per the data analyzed, HWs showed a lower proportion of comorbidities, hospitalizations and deaths 
than non -HWs, even w hen accounting for age and sex differences between the two populations (see 
figures below). These differences were especially pronounced for those aged 50 years and above.  
Further analyses are warranted to explain differences seen between infections in he alth workers and the 
general public.  
WHO guidance and resources:  
To support health and social care workers and health  facilities in managing the COVID -19 pandemic, WHO 
has produced guidance on Risk assessm ent and management of exposure of health care workers , Infection 
prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) is suspected or confirmed , 
Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID -19, Rational use of PPE for COVID -19 and considerations 
during severe shortages , IPC in long -term care facilities , Right s, roles and responsibilities of health workers, 
including key considerations for occupational safety and health ; the guidance is being continuously revised 
as new scientific information emerges. WHO has also produced a surveillance protocol targeting health 
workers who are found positive to COVID -19; as well as a WHO Academy online learning app for COVID -19.

 Key weekly updates  
 
• At WHOs Executive Board meeting ,  WHO  Director -General Dr Tedros highlighted some of WHO’s  
key actions  over the course of the pandemic : 
o Declaring a Public Health Emergency of International  (PHEIC)  Concern on 30 January;  
o Publishing the first Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan 4 days later;  
o Developing and publishing the first protocol for developing a PCR test and assisting in the 
development of the first diagnostic test;  
o Producing and shipping the diagnostic tests within a month of declaring the outbreak, 
with millions of tests distributed to more than 150 countries since then;  
o Publishing more than 400 guidance documents for indivi duals, communities, schools, 
businesses, industries, health workers, health facilities and governments;  
o Building country capacity by providing free training in 133 COVID -19 courses on 
OpenWHO.org ; 
o Working closely with g overnments to write national plans and identify needs, and to 
match those needs with more than 600 partners and 74 donors through the COVID -19 
Partners Platform ; 
o Sending expert missions to more than 130 countries to provide operational and technical 
support;  
o Sourcing, validating, purchasing and delivering masks, gloves, respirators, gowns, goggles, 
swabs, tests, reagents, thermometers, oxygen concentrators, ventilators and more, to 
177 countries and t erritories;  
o Enrolling more than 12,000 patients in the WHO Solidarity Therapeut ics Trial , in nearly 500 
hospitals in 29 countries; and  
o Launching the Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelerator , which is working on diagnostics, 
treatment, vaccines and health system strengthening . It includes COVAX  which is 
supporting the development of 9 vaccines, with more in the pipeline and aims to fairly 
distribute 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 . 
 
• “The pandemic must be a turning point for all of us; a catalyst for making universal health coverage a 
reality, and not just an aspiration ”,  urged Dr Tedros at a side event of the 75th session of the United 
Nations General Assembly . According to the  WHO global pulse survey , 90% of countries report 
disruptions to essential health services since COVID -19, with low - and middle -income countries 
reporting the greatest difficulties.    
 
• Close to a billion people are living with a mental disorder and 1 person dies every 40 seconds by 
suicide. A recent WHO survey  found that the COVID -19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical 
mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is 
increasing.  To celebrate World Mental Health Day  (Saturday 10 October),  WHO , in collaboration 
with United for Global Mental Health  and the World Federation for Mental Healt h, encouraged 
people from all countries to support a global movement calling for greater investment in mental 
health.  
 
• More than 200,000 additional stillbirths could occur over the next 12 months in 117 low - and 
middle -income countries due to severe COVID -related disruptions in health care services 
according to the first ever joint report on stillbirth  estimates .  Around 2 million babies are stillborn 
every year, with  the majority of these deaths avoided with high -quality  care antenatally and 
during birth.  
  
   
 • The International Day of the Girl , celebrated on Sunday 11 October, focuses on the importance, 
power, and potential of girls around the world.  COVID -19 represents a huge challenge for 
adolescents and young people , and  especially for girls and young women .  Young people nee d to be 
a key part of the solution to this global crisis,  working jointly with  their communities and  health 
authorities to help  break the chain of infection .

Data, t able and figure notes  
 
Data presented are based on official laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 case and deaths reported to WHO by 
country/territories/areas , largely based upon  WHO case definiti ons and surveillance guidance . While steps 
are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and 
caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with 
variable underestimation of true case and death incidence , and variable delays to reflecting these data at 
global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria , testing strategies, reporting practice s, and data cut -off and lag 
times differ between countries/territories/areas.  A small number of countries/territories/ areas report 
combined probable and laboratory -confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in 
the data table.  Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national 
public health authorities, and othe r sources.  
The designations employed,  and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any 
opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or 
of its authorities, or concerning the d elimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines    
 
   
 on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries , 
territories and areas are arranged  under the administering WHO region . 
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are 
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned. 
Errors and omission s excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital

i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting. Classifications 
are reviewed on a weekly basis and  may be revised as new in formation becomes available . Differing 
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas ; classification is based on the 
highest category reported within a country/territory/area . Categories :  
• No cases: with no confirmed cases ; 
• Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected ; 
• Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common 
exposures ; 
• Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defi ned through an 
assessment of factors including, but not limited to:  large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission 
chains ; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab oratory  surveillance ; and/or m ultiple unrelated clusters 
in several areas of the country/territory/area ; 
• Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO . 
ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.  
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances . 
Country, territory, or area -specific notes, updates and errata  
Due to public health autho rities  conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of 
cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths 
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtra ctions to be 
suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes

Global epidemiologic al situation  
Since the last Weekly Epidemiological Update  issued on 5 October, over 2.2 million new cases and 39,000 
deaths of COVID -19 have been reported across  all six WHO regions. This is the highest number of reported 
cases so far in a single week.  
  
From 30 December through 11 October, over 37 million COVID -19 cases and 1 million deaths have been 
reported globally. Nearly half of these cases (48%) and deaths (5 5%) continue to be reported in the Region of 
the Americas with the United States of America, Brazil and Argentina accounting for the greatest numbers  of 
new cases and deaths in the region.

confirmed cases.  
 
For the third week in a row, the South -East Asia Region reported a decline in new cases and deaths, 6% and 8% 
respectively, compared to the previous week. The decline is mainly due to decrease s in reported cases in India 
and Bangladesh.  
 
For the second week in a row, the Regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific reported 
increase s in cases and deaths.  
 
Overall, during the reporting period, all the Regions showed an increase in cases except the South -East Asia

 Situation by WHO Region  
African Region  
Although the Region had seen a slow but continuous decline in newly - reported cases since mid -July, there 
were 11% more cases reported in the last 7 days  compared to  the prior week, reaching a total of over 1 200 
000 cases ( Figure 1, Figure 3). The current figures in the region represent 1% of confirmed COVID -19 cases 
and 3% of deaths reported worldwide in the past week.  The increase in the number of newly - confirmed 
cases is partially attributed to the higher number of countries reporting an increase in cases (21 countries), 
compared to the previous week (14 coun tries). Although there are a greater number of countries reporting 
increases, the pattern of increasing cases is driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, which continue to report the 
highest numbers of new cases in the last 7 days, followed by Kenya, Uganda, a nd Algeria. Continuing the 
trend from last week, the number of reported deaths  increased this week with South Africa accounting  for 
the majority of the new deaths in the Region (74%).  
 
The current transmission pattern in the majority  of the 47 Member States in the African Region is reported as 
community transmission (n=39, 83%), with five reporting clusters of cases, and only Seychelles, Mauritius 
and Eritrea currently reporting sporadic cases.  
 
South Sudan has reported a decrease in the number of newly -reported cases with an epidemiological link, 
with 29% in the past week, compared to 67% the week prior. This is attributed to a decrease in the 
proportion of cases that have been  detected at a border crossing, where a history of travel can inform an 
epidemiological link.  
 
This past  week, Mozambique registered 795 new cases (25 per million population ) bringing the total figure to 
almost 10  000 cases. Nevertheless, the country has registered a gradual decline over the last three wee ks 
including a 39 and 40% decrease  in new cases and deaths respectively in the past week , suggesting the 
epidemic may be slowing down in the country.  While the number of tests per 1000 inhabitants has remained 
quite stable at 0.3 over the last 10 weeks, t he test positivity rate has dropped this week to 9%. Schools have 
reopened with special measures to prevent further spread of the virus.

 Region of the Americas  
The Region of the Americas reported over 800 000 new cases in the last seven days, a 6% increase in the number 
of new cases in the past week which is a bigger increase than the increase reported in the previous week. greater 
change than the week prior. The Unit ed States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia registered the 
highest number of newly - reported cases .  
The Region  also continues to account for a majority of all deaths reported globally in the past week (n=20 500, 
52%). Mexico, the Unit ed States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia registered the highest number of new 
deaths.  
 
This past week, t he United States of America reported the largest increase in newly -reported cases since early 
August, with over 327 000 cases  reported. Ten of the 50 states reported the highest one -day increases in cases 
since their first reported case, including many in the Midwest and the Southwest, and three states reported their 
largest- ever one -day increase in new deaths.  
  
The number of newly - reported cases has been increasing in Canada since mid -September, with an increase of 
26.7% cases and 14.3% deaths in the past week. Most of the cases and deaths were reported in Québec and 
Ontario. Outbreaks in long -term care and retirement residences continue to account for most outbreaks in 
Canada to date. Since mid -July, incidence rates in those 20 to 39 years of age have remained consistently higher 
than all other age groups. Since mid -September, an increasing trend in the daily number of cases 20 to 39 years of 
age hospitalized has been observed.  
  
Costa Rica, with the second -highest incidence of cases per million population in the Region , has now reached over 
86 000 cases and over  1 000 deaths. During the last 5 weeks, the country had reached a plateau with comparable 
figures of reported cases and deaths. The country has reported over 107 COVID -19 hospitalizations per million 
inhabitants of which over a third of them are in intensi ve care units.

 Eastern Mediterranean Region  
In the Eastern Mediterranean region the weekly number of new cases and deaths have increased by 10% and 
13% respectively in comparison to the previous week. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the worst affected  
country in the regi on, accounting for 20% of all new cases reported this week.  
 
The number of new cases in Oman has more than doubled in the last week (from approximately 2 600 to 
over 5 500)  amounting to an increase of more than 60% . This past week a 100 bed field hospital for COVID -19 
patients along with an isolation center in the city of Sohar , the capital and largest city of the Al Batinah North 
Governorate  and another isolation ward in Su r Hospita l in the South Sharqiya region were opened to help 
mitigate the rising number of COVID -19 cases in the country.   
In Tunisia, there have been peak new cases (over 2 500) and deaths (over 40) also reported this week and the 
country plans to impose increased public health and safety measures including bans on gatherings, cutting 
public sector work hours  and imposing cur fews  in an effort to interrupt  transmission.

European Region  
The Region registered the highest weekly incidence of COVID -19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic 
with almost 700 000 new cases reported. The weekly incidence in cases a nd deaths increased by 34% and 
16% respectively in comparison to the previous week ( Figure 6). The Region is the second most active, 
contributing almost a third (n=694 275, 31%) of new weekly cases reported globally. The United Kingdom, 
France, the Russian  Federation and Spain account for over half of all new cases reported in the region (n= 
355 455, 51%).  
 
Latvia, Faroe Islands and Iceland have reported the greatest percentage increase in new cases in the past 
week while a marked decrease was reported in Isle of Man, Malta and Spain. The majority of the countries in 
the region self -characteri ze their current  transmission pattern as community transmission (n=30, 56%) or 
clusters of cases (n=20, 37%) with only Liechtenstein, Monaco and the Holy See reporting sporadic 
transmission.  
  
Spain, with over 50 000 cases reported in the past week, is showing a noticeab le decline in the weekly 
incidence of cases and deaths of 24% and 19% respectively. In the past week, over 740 000 polymerase chain 
reaction ( PCR) diagnostic  tests were carried out (16 tests per 1000 inhabitants per week). As of 08 of 
October, the bed occ upancy in intensive care unit s ranged between 7% and 39% across all regions.   
The incidence of cases and deaths in Poland increased this week by 93% and 104% respectively compared to 
the previous week, with almost 23 500 new cases and 370 deaths reported. Poland is tightening public health 
and social  measures in response to these ma rked increases in an effort to avoid another lockdown. A 
coordination hospital will be created in each provide to manage the surge in COVID -19 patients.

 South -East Asia Region  
The gradual decline in incidence of cases and deaths in the South East Asia Region continued during the past 
week. The Region, nevertheless, remains among the most active, accounting for 25% of cases and 20% of 
deaths newly reported globally in the past seven days ( Figure 7).   
 
The countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the South -East Asia Region continue to be India, 
Indonesia and Nepal, while Sri Lanka and Bhutan are showing the highest increase in the proportion of new 
cases in the past week compared to the previous week. Across the ten countries in the region, only Myanmar 
and Nepal  reported  an increase in the number of new deaths  in the past week compared to the previous 
week.  The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths per million population are India and 
Myanmar, with 5 and 4 new deaths per million population respectively. In contrast to the other regions with 
currently high case incidence, most of the 10 Member States in the South -East Asian Region self -report their 
current transmission pattern as either clusters of cases (n=6) or sporadic cases (n=2), with only Bangladesh 
and Indonesia currently reporting community transmission.  
 
Sri Lanka reported over 1200 new confirmed cases in the past epidemiological week, a substantial increase 
compared to the 46 cases confirmed the previous reporting week.  In a recent development, a large cluster 
of cases (831 cases as on 7 October 2020) wa s reported in an apparel manufacturing factory in Gamphana 
district about 50 km from Colombo. The exact epidemiological link is currently under investigation  
 
The reported number of cases increased rapidly in Nepal in the past week, with over 21 000 new ca ses and 
86 new deaths reported. Although the test positivity rate has raised from 5 to 15% in just 8 weeks, there has 
also been an expansion in testing activity, which is currently around 3 samples tested / 1000 persons per 
week.

Western Pacific Region  
The Western Pacific region accounts for the least number of reported cases globally this week, however , the 
region has experienced an increase of 6% in new ly- reported cases and a 26% increase in reported deaths in 
the past seven days.  
 
New cases in the Philippines have stabilized over the past 3 weeks with around 18 000 cases reported 
weekly, lower than the peak of around 30 000 weekly new cases in early to mid - August however it does 
continue to  account for the greatest number of new cases in the region. Reports suggest  clustering of cases 
has occurred in several workplaces in Davao Region following the easing of lockdown restrictions under the 
modified general community quarantine and reopening of the econom ic measures, with most of the clusters 
reported in 12 establishments.  As of October 12, the total number of cases in Davao Region is 3,743 with 686 
cases reported in the past two weeks and Davao City (the capital) contributing 65% of the total cases in the 
region. There are also reports of near capacity utilization of ICU and Ward beds, in the ma jor hospital in the 
region last week.   
 
In French Polynesia, there  were peak new cases this week , a 62% increase from last week, with reports 
suggesting  most cases were detected from the main island of Tahiti, with cases spreading to adjacent islands 
of M oorea and even reaching several outer islands, including Raivavae, Arutua, and Nuku Hiva.  Deaths in 
French Polynesia remain low and have not increased in the past week. The positivity rate of COVID -19 tests is 
currently high, at 26.3%, how ever only symptom atic persons are being tested.

 Surveillance update of the impact of COVID -19 on health workers  
Delivering the diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine interventions for COVID -19, while maintaining essential 
health services, requires a healthy, trained, competent, equipped, protected, well -managed, and 
appropriately staffed multi -disciplinary healthcare workforce. Health and social  care workers both salaried 
and volunteer, face multiple challenges due to COVID -19, leading to either an increased workload o r 
absences from work. Challenges include  pre-existing workforce shortages; repurposing of staff to the 
COVID -19 response;  infections and deaths; quarantine and self -isolation requirements; stress and burn -
out; shortages of critical equipment and supplies,  such as personal protective equipment (PPE); 
inadequate training; labo r disputes; and having to care for infected friends and family. A comprehensive 
assessment of the impact of COVID -19 on health and socia l care workers should utilize standardized 
measu rements and reporting to adequately qualify the impact. Internationally agreed indicators exist, and 
they form part of WHO’s ongoing surveillance and communications activities. Health  and social workers, 
in contact with COVID -19 patients and/or who care fo r COVID -19 patients,  are at a higher risk of infection 
than the general population. Mitigating and reducing this risk, and following WHO guidance (see below), 
is essential.  
WHO collects case -based surveillance data from Member States using Case Report Forms (CRFs)  via the 
WHO global surveillance for COVID -19. As of 14 September 2020, the CRF database contained 8 233 444 
forms, representing 28.4% of the cases recorded globally by that date. The CRFs facilitate a descriptive 
analysis of infections, hospitalizations, c linical outcomes, and sub -population analysis (such as occupation 
notified as health worker).  
An analysis o f health worker (HW) information was conducted on 281 083 HWs from amongst 1 932 941 
CRFs that indicated HW1 status (23.5% of all CRFs) from 83 coun tries. These data, covering primarily 
European and American countries, estimate that around 14% of COVID -19 cases reported to WHO are 
identified as occurring in health workers. There are wide differences in the reported proportion of HW 
affected between co untries. The overall mean estimate of infections amongst HWs illustrates a clear over 
representation of cases, given that they represent less than 3% of the population, globally, and less than 
8% on average in high -income countries.   
Encouragingly, t he data indicate that there has been a substantial decline in HW infection since the 
beginning of the epidemic, independent of the overall change in incidence of cases. In many countries, 
this is likely due to the increased availability of PPE and better a dherence to infection prevention and 
control (IPC) guidance. Figure 9 shows monthly trends in HW infection, using data from selected European 
countries2. The trends show that in the last 3 months prior to the analysis the proportion of cases amongst 
HWs wa s closer to their share of the general population.  
 
 
 
 
1 For the purposes of the case -based surveillance, ‘health workers’ were defined as those working “any job in a health care setting”.  
2 Data covering only countries  reporting at least 70% of cases in CRF, with at least 70% of CRFs hav ing a known HW status, with at least 
500 HW infections reported.   
   
 Figure 9. Share of health workers amongst total reported infections in selected countries, by month of 
reporting, March -August 2020  
 
The mean age of COVID -19 cases of HWs was 40 years  (IQR 31 -49), lower than the mean age of non -HWs, 
46 years (IQR 31 -60). The dis tribution of HW infections in women (67%) and men (29%) (4% unknown sex) 
is proportionate to the global share of women and men in the health workforce. This is notably different 
from the ratio of infections in females versus males for the general populatio n, where males account for 
53% of cases.  
WHO compared the proportions of COVID -19 case -patients with comorbidities, hospitalization and death 
as an outcome by age categories and sex in HWs and non -HWs, using information from five countries in 
the Americas and Europe with complete data. A total of 13% (n = 37 446) of HW case -patients reported 
underlying comorbidities (Figure 10), including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, such as 
hypertension. Of HW case -patients, 5% (n = 15 141) required hospitalizatio n (Figure 11), and of these, 
5.3% (n = 799) required oxygen therapy. Overall, 0.5% (n = 1417) of the HW cases were fatal (Figure 12). 
As per the data analyzed, HWs showed a lower proportion of comorbidities, hospitalizations and deaths 
than non -HWs, even w hen accounting for age and sex differences between the two populations (see 
figures below). These differences were especially pronounced for those aged 50 years and above.  
Further analyses are warranted to explain differences seen between infections in he alth workers and the 
general public.  
WHO guidance and resources:  
To support health and social care workers and health  facilities in managing the COVID -19 pandemic, WHO 
has produced guidance on Risk assessm ent and management of exposure of health care workers , Infection 
prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) is suspected or confirmed , 
Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID -19, Rational use of PPE for COVID -19 and considerations 
during severe shortages , IPC in long -term care facilities , Right s, roles and responsibilities of health workers, 
including key considerations for occupational safety and health ; the guidance is being continuously revised 
as new scientific information emerges. WHO has also produced a surveillance protocol targeting health 
workers who are found positive to COVID -19; as well as a WHO Academy online learning app for COVID -19.

 Key weekly updates  
 
• At WHOs Executive Board meeting ,  WHO  Director -General Dr Tedros highlighted some of WHO’s  
key actions  over the course of the pandemic : 
o Declaring a Public Health Emergency of International  (PHEIC)  Concern on 30 January;  
o Publishing the first Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan 4 days later;  
o Developing and publishing the first protocol for developing a PCR test and assisting in the 
development of the first diagnostic test;  
o Producing and shipping the diagnostic tests within a month of declaring the outbreak, 
with millions of tests distributed to more than 150 countries since then;  
o Publishing more than 400 guidance documents for indivi duals, communities, schools, 
businesses, industries, health workers, health facilities and governments;  
o Building country capacity by providing free training in 133 COVID -19 courses on 
OpenWHO.org ; 
o Working closely with g overnments to write national plans and identify needs, and to 
match those needs with more than 600 partners and 74 donors through the COVID -19 
Partners Platform ; 
o Sending expert missions to more than 130 countries to provide operational and technical 
support;  
o Sourcing, validating, purchasing and delivering masks, gloves, respirators, gowns, goggles, 
swabs, tests, reagents, thermometers, oxygen concentrators, ventilators and more, to 
177 countries and t erritories;  
o Enrolling more than 12,000 patients in the WHO Solidarity Therapeut ics Trial , in nearly 500 
hospitals in 29 countries; and  
o Launching the Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelerator , which is working on diagnostics, 
treatment, vaccines and health system strengthening . It includes COVAX  which is 
supporting the development of 9 vaccines, with more in the pipeline and aims to fairly 
distribute 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 . 
 
• “The pandemic must be a turning point for all of us; a catalyst for making universal health coverage a 
reality, and not just an aspiration ”,  urged Dr Tedros at a side event of the 75th session of the United 
Nations General Assembly . According to the  WHO global pulse survey , 90% of countries report 
disruptions to essential health services since COVID -19, with low - and middle -income countries 
reporting the greatest difficulties.    
 
• Close to a billion people are living with a mental disorder and 1 person dies every 40 seconds by 
suicide. A recent WHO survey  found that the COVID -19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical 
mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is 
increasing.  To celebrate World Mental Health Day  (Saturday 10 October),  WHO , in collaboration 
with United for Global Mental Health  and the World Federation for Mental Healt h, encouraged 
people from all countries to support a global movement calling for greater investment in mental 
health.  
 
• More than 200,000 additional stillbirths could occur over the next 12 months in 117 low - and 
middle -income countries due to severe COVID -related disruptions in health care services 
according to the first ever joint report on stillbirth  estimates .  Around 2 million babies are stillborn 
every year, with  the majority of these deaths avoided with high -quality  care antenatally and 
during birth.  
  
   
 • The International Day of the Girl , celebrated on Sunday 11 October, focuses on the importance, 
power, and potential of girls around the world.  COVID -19 represents a huge challenge for 
adolescents and young people , and  especially for girls and young women .  Young people nee d to be 
a key part of the solution to this global crisis,  working jointly with  their communities and  health 
authorities to help  break the chain of infection .

Data, t able and figure notes  
 
Data presented are based on official laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 case and deaths reported to WHO by 
country/territories/areas , largely based upon  WHO case definiti ons and surveillance guidance . While steps 
are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and 
caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with 
variable underestimation of true case and death incidence , and variable delays to reflecting these data at 
global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria , testing strategies, reporting practice s, and data cut -off and lag 
times differ between countries/territories/areas.  A small number of countries/territories/ areas report 
combined probable and laboratory -confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in 
the data table.  Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national 
public health authorities, and othe r sources.  
The designations employed,  and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any 
opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or 
of its authorities, or concerning the d elimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines    
 
   
 on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries , 
territories and areas are arranged  under the administering WHO region . 
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are 
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned. 
Errors and omission s excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital 
letters.  
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1244 (1999).  In the map, number of cases of  Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been 
aggregated for visualization purposes.  
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting. Classifications 
are reviewed on a weekly basis and  may be revised as new in formation becomes available . Differing 
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas ; classification is based on the 
highest category reported within a country/territory/area . Categories :  
• No cases: with no confirmed cases ; 
• Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected ; 
• Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common 
exposures ; 
• Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defi ned through an 
assessment of factors including, but not limited to:  large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission 
chains ; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab oratory  surveillance ; and/or m ultiple unrelated clusters 
in several areas of the country/territory/area ; 
• Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO . 
ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.  
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances . 
Country, territory, or area -specific notes, updates and errata  
Due to public health autho rities  conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of
